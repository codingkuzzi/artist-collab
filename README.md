## Artist Collab

#### By _**Mick Sexton, Alena Golovina, Anna Kuznetsova, Anna Timofeyeva**_

### Description

Artist Collab is a web application for artists who want to find other like-minded creative individuals to collaborate with. Whether you want to jam or start a band, film a movie, take a painting class together, or code a video game, it takes a diverse range of talent and skills to bring a big project to fruition. Artist Collab can help you find talent across the globe or in your local community based on other artists' skills or proximity.

Or maybe you don't want to start a whole project yourself. Maybe you want to lend your amazing talents to someone in need. Whether you are an editing guy who wants to help out a local filmmaker, or an amazing banjo player willing to lend your dexterity on a studio track, or a talented mural painter looking for a spot to legally put up your work, Artist Collab can help you find the right avenue for your abilities and expertise.

* `In psql CREATE DATABASE artist_collab;`
* `In separate terminal, run: psql artist_collab < media.sql;`
